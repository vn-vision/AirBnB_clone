# 0x00 AirBnb clone - The console

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
    Manage the objects of our project:
        Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
        Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
        Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
        Update attributes of an object
        Destroy an object
